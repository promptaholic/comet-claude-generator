## Complexity Decision Guide

Not sure which complexity level you need? Use this guide:

### Choose **Simple** if:
- ✅ Single, focused task
- ✅ No specialized domain knowledge required
- ✅ No external tools/APIs needed
- ✅ Can be explained in one sentence
- ✅ Setup should take <5 minutes

**Examples:** Email responder, text summarizer, format converter, simple Q&A

### Choose **Medium** if:
- ✅ Multiple related tasks
- ✅ Domain-specific knowledge helpful
- ✅ Different workflows for different scenarios
- ✅ Professional/production use
- ✅ Setup ~15 minutes acceptable

**Examples:** Content repurposer, code reviewer, document analyzer, specialized assistant

### Choose **Complex** if:
- ✅ Multi-step workflows required
- ✅ External tools/APIs essential
- ✅ Agent-based architecture needed
- ✅ State management important
- ✅ Production-scale application
- ✅ Setup 25-30 minutes acceptable

**Examples:** Research pipeline, data processing system, multi-agent coordinator, API integrator
